-The Module and source file names of VertexPaintDetection_Uncooked and VertexPaintDetectionPlugin are very bad, but unfortunately they can't be changed without the risk of peoples project getting compromised. The plugin started off as a simple prototype and should've thought of better naming right from the start. 


-The ToolbarButton module is for UE5 only, since the Editor Widget cannot be opened anyway in UE4 since it has been modified in UE5. 
You can find information on how to register physics surfaces manually etc. for UE4 on the marketplace page.
